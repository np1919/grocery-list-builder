for windows:

in order to run the menu:

type `cmd` into the start menu/run/search bar

type `cd` then a series of folders to move into THIS folder (ie. Recipes for DJ)

type `python3 main.py` to run the menu. 

select your items, by entering the associated number from the menu

finally, type `checkout` to return the list of items!

If you'd prefer a different output type (like a .txt file or .csv) just lmk, it's a small change.

Enjoy DJ, take care
